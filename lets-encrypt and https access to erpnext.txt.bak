Dear Javid_Hussain and all friend,

Now, it work I can used https://mycompany.com 30.

Dear new ERPNext user,

If you are new for Linux/google cloud/ERPNext don’t panic and stay clam. ERPNext are easy to setup in google cloud. Below are my step that it work for me (I don’t understand it but it work)

run command in your google ssh (yourname : accouut in google)

yourname@testsystem:~$ apt-get update
yourname@testsystem:~$apt-get upgrade
yourname@testsystem:~$wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/playbooks/install.py 15
sudo python install.py --production
yourname@testsystem:~$sudo python install.py --production
If you have no any error you will have http://ipaddress 2 for ERPNext, if you map you ipaddress with DNS service you will have http://youcompany.com as ERPNext web service

Next we need to make it to Https://yourcompany.com for your safety.

yourname@testsystem:~$ sudo su - frappe
frappe@testsystem:~$ cd frappe-bench/sites
frappe@testsystem:~/frappe-bench/sites$ mv site1.local mycompany.com
frappe@testsystem:~/frappe-bench/sites$ nano mycompany.com/site_config.json 7
nano just like text edit if you never used like me just check at youtobe, change text to

Add the following line.
“host_name”: “http://mycompany.com”,

It should look like below
{
“db_name”: “site1.local”,
“db_password”: “*********”,
“host_name”: “http://domain.org 18”
}
Save and exit
9) frappe@testsystem:~/frappe-bench/sites$ cd …
10) frappe@testsystem:~/frappe-bench$ sudo -H bench setup lets-encrypt mycompany.com

After this step will request you to put some information just put … woww, you will get https://
